# codex-swap (`xswap`)

A CLI for running Codex under different ChatGPT accounts, with usage reporting, directory mappings, portable account backups, optional shared conversation history and opt-in seamless rotation for a compatible Codext build. Inspired by the `cswap run` workflow from [claude-swap](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap), using the permanent account-directory approach from [swapdex](https://github.com/youdie006/swapdex).

Save your current Codex login with `xswap add`, then use `xswap switch` to change the login used by a plain `codex` command. Saved accounts have private credential snapshots. The globally active account uses the main Codex home; explicit launches of other accounts use their separate homes. Codex owns token refresh.

## Install

Supports macOS 11 or newer, Linux, WSL and native Windows on ARM64 and x86-64. Install the official Codex CLI separately and make sure `codex` is on PATH.

### macOS and Linux (install script)

Install or upgrade the native executable with one command, without Homebrew, Rust or administrator access:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/maddada/codex-swap/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The script selects the build for your computer (native Apple Silicon even from a Rosetta shell; static musl on Linux), verifies the archive against the release’s SHA-256 checksums and checks `xswap --version` before installing `xswap` to `~/.local/bin`. `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` go to `~/.local/share/doc/codex-swap` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/doc/codex-swap`). It uses `curl` or `wget`, needs no terminal input and never edits shell profiles; it prints a note when the directory is not on PATH. Set `XSWAP_VERSION=0.3.4` for a specific release or `XSWAP_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/bin` for another directory.

The script writes `.xswap-install-receipt.json` beside the executable, recording the method, directory, version and the executable’s SHA-256. `xswap upgrade` reruns the same installer for that directory when the receipt matches the running executable.

### Homebrew (recommended)

Run this command to install on macOS and linux (requires homebrew to be installed)

```sh
brew tap maddada/tap && brew trust --formula maddada/tap/codex-swap && brew install maddada/tap/codex-swap
```

This command adds the tap, marks it as trusted, then installs codex-swap.

Homebrew installs a prebuilt `xswap` executable, with `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` in its documentation directory. Rust and Cargo are not required. Linux releases are statically linked with musl, so they do not depend on a particular glibc version.

To update:

```sh
xswap upgrade
```

For Homebrew installations on macOS and Linux this runs `brew upgrade maddada/tap/codex-swap`; install-script installations rerun the install script for the same directory. `xswap update` and `xswap --upgrade` are also accepted, matching cswap.

### Windows (PowerShell)

Install or upgrade the native executable with one command:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/maddada/codex-swap/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer selects x64 or ARM64, verifies the archive against the release’s SHA-256 checksums and installs the executable, `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\codex-swap`, adding it to your user PATH. Upgrades replace the executable and notices together, restoring the previous files if replacement fails. No Cargo or administrator access is needed for installation. Open a new terminal afterward. `xswap upgrade` runs the same installer for the directory containing your current executable.

Managed accounts share configuration through symbolic links. Enable **Windows Developer Mode** (or grant your account the Create symbolic links privilege) before creating or importing managed accounts or enabling shared history. Existing adopted homes can run without shared links. npm’s `codex.cmd` launcher is supported. Windows batch launchers use Rust’s batch-file handling through `cmd.exe`, which can reject special-character or multiline arguments. Use a native `codex.exe` via `--codex-bin` for those prompts.

For an explicit version or installation directory, download the script and run it locally:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/maddada/codex-swap/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
.\install.ps1 -Version v0.3.1 -InstallDir "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\codex-swap"
```

Use `-NoPathUpdate` to manage PATH yourself. The installer also upgrades existing installations; a running old executable is retired and cleaned up by a later installer run after it exits.

### Download a binary

Download the archive for your computer and `SHA256SUMS` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/maddada/codex-swap/releases/latest):

| Computer | Archive target |
| --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| macOS Intel | `x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| Linux / WSL ARM64 | `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Linux / WSL x86-64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Windows ARM64 | `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| Windows x64 | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |

Verify the downloaded archive against its entry in `SHA256SUMS` using `shasum -a 256` on macOS, `sha256sum` on Linux or `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` in PowerShell. Unix archives contain `xswap`; Windows ZIP archives contain `xswap.exe`. Extract the executable into a directory on PATH and retain the accompanying `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Any product embedding or redistributing the executable must include these documents. No compiler is needed.

### Build from source

Developers building from source need Rust 1.85 or newer:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/mattdone-ai/codex-swap \
  --branch feature/autoswitch --locked --root ~/.local
xswap --version
```

From a checkout:

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked --root ~/.local
```

Until the autoswitch branch is merged into the fork's default branch, install it
with the explicit `--branch feature/autoswitch` command above or from a checkout
of that branch. Do not use `xswap upgrade` for this branch-only build: Cargo
upgrades fetch the fork's default branch. From a checkout, update the branch and
repeat `cargo install --path . --locked --force --root ~/.local` instead.

Run the same native Rust gates used before commits with:

```sh
make precommit
```

The target checks that every file under `src/` and `tests/` is tracked, then
runs formatting, the full test suite, Clippy with warnings denied, and a release
build.

The commands above install `xswap` into `~/.local/bin`. Omit `--root ~/.local`
to use Cargo's default `~/.cargo/bin` directory instead; the service template
supports both locations.

On macOS and Linux, `xswap upgrade` first recognises install-script installations by their receipt, then detects Cargo installations and runs `cargo install --git https://github.com/mattdone-ai/codex-swap --locked --force --root <original-root>`, including for installations originally built with `--path`. This installs the fork's default branch; use the checkout command above while autoswitch remains branch-only. Detection follows executable symlinks and preserves custom install roots. Homebrew installations use Homebrew without requiring Cargo. An unrecognized Unix installation prints manual upgrade instructions and exits with status 1; a missing package manager also exits with status 1. Package-manager output and exit status are preserved, and upgrading does not initialize accounts or launch Codex.

## Set up accounts

Close existing Codex sessions. Sign into the first account using Codex, then save it after the login command exits:

```sh
codex login
xswap add --alias personal
```

Before signing into another account, save the current account again to capture any credentials Codex refreshed. Then register the new login:

```sh
xswap add
codex login
xswap add --alias work
xswap list
```

`add` snapshots the current file-based ChatGPT credentials into a private managed account home. Changing the normal Codex login afterward does not overwrite the saved account. Saving an already registered identity refreshes that account’s saved credentials rather than creating a duplicate slot. Existing aliases and directory mappings stay attached to the account. After reauthentication, run `xswap add` again to save the replacement credentials. A direct `codex login` replaces the previous main-home login; xswap cannot recover refreshed credentials that were overwritten before they were saved.

The original account means the first saved account from the main Codex home. `xswap switch default` restores it. Existing 0.2 registries preserve their original account’s slot and alias when moving its credentials from an adopted main home into a managed snapshot.

As a convenience, xswap can also open Codex’s sign-in flow directly in a new account home:

```sh
xswap add --login --alias secondary --share-history
# On a headless computer:
xswap add --login --alias another --share-history --device-auth
```

Enter the new account’s email when prompted, or pass `--email user@example.com`, then choose that account in the browser. xswap verifies the returned email and rejects accounts already registered. The slot is saved only after login succeeds; cancellation or a mismatched email leaves saved accounts unchanged.

To reconnect an existing account:

```sh
xswap login 2
```

You can choose an explicit slot or register a login from another Codex home:

```sh
xswap add --slot 5 --alias another
xswap add --home ~/.codex-profiles/work --alias work
```

Email selection is case-insensitive. If the same email belongs to multiple workspaces, select a slot number or unique alias.

Aliases are 1-64 ASCII letters, digits, dots, hyphens or underscores. They cannot start with a hyphen, be a number or be `default`; aliases are unique regardless of case. To repair an older alias beginning with a hyphen, use its slot number: `xswap rename 2 work-team`.

## Run, resume and fork

```sh
xswap run personal --share-history
xswap run work --share-history
xswap run 2 --share-history -- resume SESSION_ID
xswap run work --share-history -- fork SESSION_ID
xswap run user@example.com --share-history -- --model MODEL "Your prompt"
```

Everything after `--` is passed as individual arguments to Codex. Unix and native Windows `.exe` launches do not use a shell; Windows `.cmd`/`.bat` launchers have the batch-file limitations described above. xswap preserves the working directory, terminal and Codex exit status. On Windows, Codex and its descendants are tied to the launcher’s lifetime: closing or killing xswap ends that spawned process tree. It does not add permission-bypass flags. If you want those, put them in your own wrappers:

```sh
x1() { xswap run personal --share-history -- --yolo "$@"; }
xw() { xswap run work --share-history -- --yolo "$@"; }
xr() { x1 resume "$@"; }
xf() { x1 fork "$@"; }
```

Account selection removes inherited `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the child environment. Registered accounts use Codex's file credential backend. Overrides of that backend, or of `sqlite_home` while sharing history, are rejected rather than silently changing the selected account or conversation store. Other Codex arguments are forwarded unchanged.

## Run one seamless Codext session

Seamless rotation is explicit and isolated from stock Codex. It requires a patched Codext build that implements the xswap managed-runtime credential lock contract. Configure its absolute path and verified SHA-256 digest without changing the executable used by ordinary `run`, `login`, or global switching:

```sh
xswap config set seamless-codext-bin /absolute/path/to/patched/codext
xswap config set seamless-codext-sha256 VERIFIED_64_CHARACTER_SHA256
xswap session
xswap session -- resume SESSION_ID
```

`xswap session [ACCOUNT] -- [CODEXT_ARGS]` creates a persistent private runtime at `<xswap-data>/runtime/seamless`, seeds it from the selected account on first use, and launches the pinned binary. A later session resumes the runtime's active account; an explicit different account is refused once the runtime exists because live rotation owns that credential boundary. `xswap status` reports the global and seamless active accounts separately without reporting tokens.

Automatic reload and parked usage-limit continuation are Codext TUI features. `xswap session` supports the interactive TUI and its `resume`/`fork` commands. xswap forces those sessions to use Codext's embedded patched backend, preventing a shared app-server daemon from replacing the pinned build through its updater. Commands that attach to a shared/remote daemon, as well as `exec` and `review`, are rejected. A foreground `app-server` remains available; it reloads a rotated account at the next turn boundary, while its clients still own quota-error retries.

The runtime shares transcripts, archives, prompt history, session index, writer locks and user configuration with the main Codex home. Its SQLite databases stay local to the runtime, so a newer Codext cannot migrate the database used by stock Codex. Codext can still discover and resume closed stock sessions from the shared rollout files. Account credentials, logs and other runtime state remain isolated.

The runtime contains a regular mode-0600 `.xswap-managed-runtime` marker with exact contents `v1` followed by a newline. xswap creates this marker only with a new private runtime and refuses to adopt an existing unmarked directory. xswap and compatible Codext builds serialize credential capture, refresh and activation with an exclusive advisory lock at `auth.json.xswap.lock`. xswap verifies the configured executable digest before every launch and forces file-based authentication. On Unix, the pinned artifact must have no write bits (mode `0555`); xswap holds that verified inode through `exec`, so an atomic path replacement cannot change the launched bytes. The companion Codext patch supplied in `contrib/codext/` supports this managed runtime on Unix and fails closed when the marker is present on Windows; ordinary unmarked Codext behavior and xswap's other Windows workflows remain supported. A stock or unpatched Codex build does not satisfy this contract and must not be launched through `xswap session`.

## Switch the global Codex login

Exit existing Codex sessions, then switch:

```sh
xswap switch work
codex                         # now uses work
xswap switch personal
xswap switch                  # next complete, enabled account
xswap switch default           # restore the original saved account
xswap --status --json          # cswap-compatible spelling
xswap --switch-to 1            # cswap-compatible spelling
```

`switch` saves the latest outgoing main-home credentials before restoring the selected account into the main home’s regular `auth.json`. It also sets the saved default for future `xswap run` launches. Self-switching keeps the live credentials, including refreshes Codex has already performed. The command does not create an auth symlink or refresh tokens itself.

Existing Codex processes cache authentication. Before replacing the global login, xswap conservatively refuses while it detects a running Codex process for your user, including independently launched Codex sessions and sessions using another account home. In a terminal xswap lists those processes and offers to end them; `--stop-codex` ends them without asking, and `XSWAP_STOP_CODEX=never` always refuses instead. Restart Codex after switching. The check detects existing processes, but a new external launch does not share xswap’s lock. Keep Codex closed until `add` or `switch` finishes so it cannot write cached credentials during the operation.

On Windows, the Codex desktop app must also exit completely before a global switch. Recent Microsoft Store builds run as `ChatGPT.exe` inside the `OpenAI.Codex` package; xswap checks that package path to distinguish Codex from the separate ChatGPT app. Run the switch from an external PowerShell window, then reopen Codex desktop and start new CLI sessions:

```powershell
xswap switch 2
codex login status
```

`xswap run 2` selects account 2 only for that CLI launch; it does not change the desktop account. `list` showing `present` means that local credentials exist, not that the server accepts them. Check a saved account with `xswap usage 2`. If its credentials are rejected, reconnect that account with `xswap login 2`, complete the browser sign-in for the matching email, and retry. Avoid `codex logout` when switching: use the saved accounts instead.

If Windows denies process inspection, xswap reports the blocking PID and leaves the global login unchanged. Close that process, or run the external PowerShell window with the same privileges as that process. This can happen when an elevated terminal is open alongside a normal terminal.

`status` reports the identity currently installed in the main Codex home; `launchDefault` separately reports the saved choice for `xswap run`. Signing into another account directly with `codex login` can change the global login without changing that saved choice. Run `xswap add` to save the new login, or `xswap switch ACCOUNT` to restore a saved account.

Explicit `xswap run work` and directory mappings select an account for that launch without switching the global login. An explicit `xswap run default` selects the saved original account, even when a different account is globally active.

An invalid, incomplete or unsupported login in the main Codex home does not block listing, launching, reconnecting or exporting an account with a separate saved home. xswap reports a main-login diagnostic on stderr and uses the selected account's own credentials unless a valid main identity positively matches it. `status` still reports main-home errors, and global switching refuses to replace an unrecognized main login. Entries whose saved home is the main home still report errors from that source. Home aliases resolve to their physical destinations so leases and main-home replacement checks apply to the same directory.

## Directory mappings

```sh
xswap map work ~/projects/company
xswap map personal ~/projects/company/personal-tool
xswap map                          # list mappings
xswap run                          # choose the mapping for this directory
xswap unmap ~/projects/company/personal-tool
```

A mapping applies to its directory and all subfolders. The nearest mapped ancestor wins. Paths are canonicalized, so a symlink to the same project uses the same mapping. Omit the directory in `map ACCOUNT` or `unmap` to use the current directory. `unmap` removes only the exact directory’s mapping; removing a nested mapping reveals its parent’s mapping again.

Selection order is an explicit `xswap run ACCOUNT`, then the nearest directory mapping, then the saved global default. `xswap run default` explicitly chooses the saved original account. `status` reports the installed main-home login; `switch` updates it and the saved launch default. Mapping `default` requires the original account to be saved first with `xswap add`.

Mappings stay attached to their account when you rename aliases or move/swap slots. Removing an account clears its mappings. If a mapped account is disabled, a bare launch fails with a clear message instead of choosing another account.

## Usage and pacing

```sh
xswap usage                        # saved global default
xswap usage work
xswap usage --all
xswap usage --all --json
```

Usage reports each available Codex quota window’s percentage used and remaining, duration, reset timestamp and time until reset. It also includes additional model-specific or code-review windows and extra-use credits when the service reports them. A weekly window is identified by its reported duration even when Codex sends it in the primary slot.

Malformed optional model limits are skipped while healthy core and supplementary windows remain available. Console output shows a warning, and JSON includes `usage.warnings` when supplementary data was skipped. Warnings identify the field or entry number and validation failure without including response contents. A missing or null `additional_rate_limits` field produces no warning; malformed core quotas still fail the account report.

Pacing estimates end-of-window usage from the amount used and time elapsed. `ahead` means at least 10% projected quota remains; `on_track` means less than 10% remains; `behind` means the quota is projected to run out before reset. An exhaustion estimate appears only when it precedes reset. Pacing is unavailable for zero usage, a missing/expired reset window, or until at least 60 seconds and 1% of the window have elapsed. It is an estimate of a changing usage rate.

The API request and pacing follow [OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage). xswap reads the account’s current Codex access token and account ID to request `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`. Codex still owns token refresh. If a token is expired, run Codex for that account to refresh it or use `xswap login ACCOUNT`. `list` and `status` remain local and make no usage requests. `--all` includes disabled accounts and reports account failures individually; it exits unsuccessfully if any report fails while preserving successful reports in the output.

## Automatic quota switching

After registering at least two accounts, run one evaluation or a foreground
polling loop:

```sh
xswap auto --once --dry-run
xswap auto --json
xswap auto --seamless --once --dry-run
xswap auto --seamless --json
```

The default policy checks every 60 seconds. It triggers independently at 94%
of a reported 5-hour Codex window or 98% of a reported 7-day Codex window,
including a weekly window reported in the provider's primary slot. It waits 300
seconds after a successful switch and moves proactively to any safe account with
strictly better positive runway. After three consecutive unreadable samples it
fails over only to an account with the configured 10-point safety margin. At a
hard 100% limit it may land on the best account with any measured headroom.
Unknown, stale, malformed, or failed usage is never treated as healthy.

Core Codex windows bind by default. Add comma-separated supplementary provider
scope names explicitly; unrelated `code_review` limits do not bind unless named:

```sh
xswap config set autoswitch.supplementary-scopes model_name
xswap config set autoswitch.five-hour-threshold 94
xswap config set autoswitch.seven-day-threshold 98
xswap config list
```

`xswap auto` never stops Codex. Stock Codex caches authentication, so when a
switch is due while any Codex session is running the daemon emits
`blocked-running-codex` and retries later. Exit all stock Codex sessions before
the global account changes, then restart them. `--dry-run` never writes active
credentials. JSON mode emits one object per line for service logs.

`xswap auto --seamless` reads the active identity and current access token from
the isolated runtime; inactive accounts still use their saved snapshots. On a
switch, it holds the managed-runtime credential lock, saves the outgoing
runtime credentials into that account's isolated saved home, and atomically
installs the target snapshot into the runtime. The patched Codext reloads the
new identity between turns and resumes a parked usage-limit continuation. It
never writes the main `~/.codex/auth.json`, bypasses the stock process guard, or
kills a Codex process. A concurrent Codext token refresh produces a retryable
busy result, and the next poll reevaluates fresh credentials and quota state.

A user-service template is provided at `contrib/xswap-auto.service`. Copy it to
`~/.config/systemd/user/`, then use `systemctl --user daemon-reload` and
`systemctl --user enable --now xswap-auto.service` only after accounts and a
dry run have been verified.

## Manage accounts

```sh
xswap rename work company
xswap rename company --clear
xswap move 2 5                     # swaps if slot 5 is occupied
xswap swap 1 5
xswap disable 5
xswap enable 5
```

Renaming, enabling, disabling, moving and swapping work while that account's Codex sessions run. Aliases must be unique, ignoring case. Moving or swapping changes only slot numbers, preserving account homes, credentials, directory mappings and the account selected as global default. `disable` prevents implicit selection, rotation and choosing that account as a new mapping. An explicit switch or run can still select a disabled account. It does not erase credentials, stop running sessions or remove a saved default/mapping. Explicit commands such as `xswap run 5` still work; a disabled implicit choice produces an error until you enable it or explicitly select another account.

## Back up and migrate accounts

```sh
xswap export accounts-backup.json
xswap export work-backup.json --account work
xswap import accounts-backup.json
xswap import accounts-backup.json --remap-slots
```

**Backups contain plaintext login credentials.** xswap creates a new private JSON file and refuses to overwrite an existing file. Keep backups private and transfer them securely. The backup includes account credentials, aliases, slot numbers, enabled state, history-sharing preferences and the selected default. It excludes conversation history, configuration files, directory mappings and machine-local paths.

Import creates fresh managed account homes and validates all accounts before saving the registry. Imported shared settings/history use the destination computer’s main Codex home. Duplicate identities or aliases are refused. Occupied slots are refused unless `--remap-slots` is provided; remapping allocates free slots and prints the assignments. Failed validation leaves the saved registry unchanged and removes staged credentials. An import restores its backed-up launch default into an empty registry; an established registry keeps its existing launch default. Import does not change the installed global Codex login or redefine the destination’s original account. Use `xswap switch ACCOUNT` when you want to activate an imported account globally.

If saving the registry fails during import or `add --login`, xswap restores the previous registry before removing the new account homes. If that restoration also fails, xswap retains the new homes and reports their paths for recovery.

Export reads the latest main-home credentials for the globally active account and the saved home for inactive accounts. It works while that account's Codex sessions run. Imported credentials do not invalidate the original copy, but Codex’s refresh-token behavior still applies when using copies on multiple machines.

## What is shared

New managed homes share existing main-home settings and customizations: `config.toml`, named `*.config.toml` profiles, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `skills`, `hooks`, `hooks.json`, `rules` and `agents`. These are symlinks, so edits are shared. Adopted homes keep their own configuration.

Managed launches also preserve relative `model_instructions_file`, `model_catalog_json`, `experimental_compact_prompt_file` and agent role `config_file` references from the main config and selected profile. Referenced files are linked within the account home; agent role directories are linked so nested references retain the role file's base. Put relative role files in a subdirectory such as `agents/`, or use an absolute path. Active references that require writing outside the managed home, root-level relative role files, account runtime paths and conflicting destination files are refused with guidance. Home references overridden by enabled project config or CLI settings are left to Codex's higher layer. Runtime aliases are checked against the account filesystem, including Codex's default `log` directory. Missing assets keep a link to their source; Codex decides whether the effective settings require them. Source settings remain editable through the existing shared config links.

Asset linking inspects user, selected-profile, project and CLI settings. If a system config, legacy managed config or macOS managed preference contains file paths, runtime locations, project-root markers or trust entries, relative user assets are conservatively refused because those controlled layers can change the projection. Use absolute file references in the shared config or launch Codex directly. xswap does not reproduce Codex's full managed-policy loader.

Help/version requests and `exec --ignore-user-config` skip user-asset inspection, as Codex does; arguments after the forwarded `--` remain literal. On case-insensitive filesystems, new links with non-ASCII relative path components, or non-ASCII runtime locations, are conservatively refused because native Unicode aliases can overlap private account state. Use absolute asset references for those paths. Safe Unicode asset paths remain supported on case-sensitive filesystems.

New login and reauthentication copy configs independently and resolve these file references against their original home. Native login can write its staging config without changing source settings, credentials or conversations. Adopted homes retain their own configuration base.

`--share-history` enables sharing with the main Codex home for:

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sessions/` | Conversation transcripts and resume/fork |
| `archived_sessions/` | Archived transcripts |
| `session_index.jsonl` | Session names and lookup |
| `history.jsonl` | Prompt history |
| `thread-writer-locks/` | One active writer per conversation across accounts |
| SQLite state directory | Thread discovery and related persistent state |

The SQLite directory is selected through Codex's `sqlite_home` configuration, keeping databases and their WAL/SHM files together. If the main `config.toml` specifies `sqlite_home`, xswap uses it; otherwise it uses the main Codex home. Paths expand bare `~` and `~/...` against the user home (`~\...` is also supported on Windows, using its native profile directory); other relative paths resolve against the main Codex home. `.` and `..` are normalized without creating the destination. An inherited `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` is not used as the sharing anchor. Account credentials, logs and account-local runtime state remain in their account home. History sharing is remembered once enabled.

Enable sharing when adding an account, before it creates private history. If an adopted or previously private home already contains history at these paths, xswap refuses to overwrite it. Preserve and merge that history explicitly before linking it, or keep that home private. Existing links must point to the chosen main home. xswap also refuses divergent config files or links rather than erasing them. If a Codex operation replaces a shared symlink with a real file, preserve/merge that file before the next shared launch; xswap detects the divergence.

Sharing means conversations are available to all the accounts you opt in. Resuming a conversation sends its context using the newly selected account. Sharing across Claude and Codex is not supported; this tool manages Codex only.

## Reauthenticate and remove

```sh
xswap login work
xswap login work --device-auth
xswap remove work
```

Reauthentication shows the expected saved account and opens a fresh Codex sign-in. Choosing the wrong browser account or cancelling leaves existing credentials unchanged. Retry the same `xswap login ACCOUNT` command and select the intended account; this also repairs a saved home left with another account’s credentials by an older version. A successful sign-in preserves the slot, alias and mappings.

Reauthentication works while Codex sessions on that account keep running: the new login replaces the same account's credentials, and running sessions pick it up the next time they refresh their token. When that account is active in the managed seamless runtime, the same auth lock also updates the runtime copy so a later rotation cannot restore older credentials. Replacing a main-home login that belongs to a different account still requires existing Codex processes to be closed first. Removal also works while that account's sessions run, since it keeps the account's files. Other accounts remain available during login.

`remove` unregisters the account and prints its retained directory. It does **not** delete credentials or history, and does not log out Codex. Removing the selected launch default returns future launches to the saved original account when available. Removal does not rewrite the installed global login. Slot numbers are not automatically reused.

## Configuration and cleanup

```sh
xswap config
xswap config path
xswap config get codex-bin
xswap config set codex-bin /path/to/codex
xswap config set default-account work
xswap config unset codex-bin
xswap config unset default-account
```

The supported preferences are `codex-bin` (default `codex`), `default-account` (default `default`, the saved original account), `seamless-codext-bin`, and `seamless-codext-sha256`. Preferences live in the registry shown by `config path`. `config set default-account ACCOUNT` performs the same global switch as `xswap switch ACCOUNT`, including its running-Codex guard. `config unset default-account` switches back to the saved original account. The preference stores a slot so renames and moves keep selecting the same account. `config get` and `config list` show the saved preference or its default. For launches/login, executable selection is `--codex-bin`, then `XSWAP_CODEX_BIN`, then the saved preference, then `codex` on PATH. A relative executable path saved by `config set` is resolved when you set it. Seamless sessions require both Codext preferences and execute the exact file whose digest was verified.

To erase xswap’s registry, preferences, mappings and managed account credentials/history:

```sh
xswap purge
# Noninteractive, explicitly confirm the deletion:
xswap purge --yes
```

`purge` requires typing `purge` at its interactive prompt or passing `--yes`. While Codex sessions or sign-ins still use an xswap account, purge names those processes and, in a terminal, offers to end them (`--stop-codex` ends them without asking). It deletes the managed `accounts/` tree, including homes retained by earlier `remove` commands, and abandoned sign-in staging created with the current xswap provenance marker. The marker binds staging to its filesystem directory identity; `login-*`/`new-login-*` names alone never authorize deletion. Unmarked legacy staging or unrelated folders with those prefixes stop purge before confirmation: inspect the reported directory and move it outside the data directory before retrying, or remove it manually only after confirming it is abandoned sign-in data.

Original and adopted Codex homes, and the targets of shared settings/history links, remain intact. Purge refuses if a cleanup directory overlaps an original/adopted home, or an account/sign-in has a live xswap lease. Staging must be owned real directories inside the private data root; links and invalid candidates cause an error. Sign-in staging stays leased through credential saving; interrupted launchers retain that lease in their Unix child, and Windows terminates the child with the launcher.

Before deletion, staging is moved into a fresh private quarantine and its captured filesystem identity is verified there. A changed object or cleanup failure is retained at the reported quarantine path for manual recovery, and a remaining quarantine stops subsequent purge attempts. This narrows replacement races at the original staging path; advisory leases and private quarantine do not defend against hostile code running as the same OS user and mutating the quarantine itself.

JSON preserves `managedHomesRemoved` and reports staging separately as `loginStagingHomesRemoved`. Advisory lock files remain so concurrent processes keep using the same locks. The installed executable is retained; use Homebrew or your installer directory to uninstall it separately.

## JSON interface for integrations

```sh
xswap list --json
xswap status --json
xswap switch work --json
xswap add --alias personal --json
xswap remove work --json
xswap map --json
xswap usage --all --json
xswap config get codex-bin --json
```

Successful JSON operations emit one object to stdout; login messages and diagnostics go to stderr. Account objects contain:

```json
{
  "number": 2,
  "alias": "work",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "accountId": "account-id",
  "userId": "chatgpt-user-id",
  "plan": "pro",
  "home": "/path/to/effective/codex/home",
  "savedHome": "/path/to/saved/account/home",
  "managed": true,
  "enabled": true,
  "shareHistory": true,
  "isDefault": false,
  "loginStatus": "present"
}
```

Every response has `schemaVersion: 1`. `list` contains `accounts`; `add` contains `account`; `status` and `switch` contain `active`, `defaultHome` and `usesOriginalDefault`; `remove` contains `removed` and `retainedHome`. `active` describes a saved account matching the actual main-home login, or is null when that login does not match a registered account. `launchDefault` reports the separately saved launch choice. Each account’s `home` is its effective credential/launch home (the main home when globally active); `savedHome` is its stored snapshot directory. Use `home` when reading current authentication or usage.

`loginStatus` is `present`, `login_required`, `invalid_credentials`, or `identity_changed`. `present` means structurally valid credentials exist locally; it does **not** promise that the server will accept the token or that quota remains. Identity fields can be null before login completes. Console and JSON status output omit tokens; `export` writes credentials only to the requested backup file. No command rotates tokens itself. Integrations must tolerate additional fields in future versions.

xswap follows Codex's authentication-mode precedence: explicit `chatgpt` permits stored credentials for other modes, but a missing/null mode with a non-null API key, personal access token, or Bedrock credential is rejected. Legacy ChatGPT files with missing/null mode and missing/null material for those other modes remain supported. `list` marks incompatible saved snapshots `invalid_credentials`. Incompatible main-home authentication makes `status` and `switch` return an authentication error. Use `xswap login <slot-or-alias>` to sign in with the registered ChatGPT identity. Credentials and account metadata stay in place until a verified login succeeds.

`usage` performs an on-demand request. Automatic switching runs only when `xswap auto` is explicitly started or its optional user service is enabled. `contrib/xswap-auto.service` remains the stock global-switch service; install `contrib/xswap-seamless.service` for the managed Codext runtime. Stock global switching retains its running-process guard; seamless switching requires the isolated patched-Codext workflow above.

## Storage and authentication scope

On macOS/Linux, the registry defaults to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/codex-swap` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is absolute, otherwise `~/.local/share/codex-swap`. On native Windows it defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-swap`. It contains `accounts.json`, permanent account directories, and advisory lock files. Registry writes are atomic. On Unix, registry/account directories use mode 0700 and registry/lock files use mode 0600; Windows uses owner-only ACLs. Codex writes its own `auth.json` credentials. Protect this runtime directory like your normal Codex home.

| Option / environment | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--data-dir` / `XSWAP_HOME` | Separate xswap registry and managed homes |
| `--codex-home` / `XSWAP_CODEX_HOME` | Main Codex login, configuration and history home |
| `--codex-bin` / `XSWAP_CODEX_BIN` | Codex executable, default `codex` on PATH |
| `seamless-codext-bin` preference | Absolute patched Codext executable used only by `xswap session` |
| `seamless-codext-sha256` preference | Required SHA-256 pin verified before every seamless launch |

On first use, the main home defaults to `CODEX_HOME`, then `~/.codex` (`%USERPROFILE%\.codex` on Windows). It is persisted on the first registry mutation, so an inherited account-specific `CODEX_HOME` does not subsequently move the sharing anchor. A different explicit main home requires a different registry.

xswap manages **file-based ChatGPT logins**. New managed accounts select that backend explicitly through the official login command. It does not import OS-keyring/auto credentials, API-key logins or externally managed tokens. For a keyring-based existing setup, use `xswap add --login` to create an independent login instead of copying a potentially stale `auth.json`. Managed enterprise requirements still apply through Codex itself.

Saved logins match by workspace (`accountId`) and stable ChatGPT member (`userId`); email and plan changes do not create a new account when both user IDs are known. Older logins or registries without a user ID require a shared nonempty email. Registry metadata stays in place, and a safely matched save, login or switch fills in the user ID. Missing owner evidence or multiple legacy matches require repairing the registration; xswap never assigns the current main-home login to an unknown saved owner.

Older registered homes physically separate from the main home resolve their user ID in memory from their saved identity token only when its workspace and known nonempty email match the registry. This includes adopted homes outside the store. Read-only commands leave the registry and credentials unchanged. Missing, unreadable or mismatched hints cannot match an installed main login; matching email-only legacy tokens retain their fallback. Owner labels may survive an unusable authentication mode, but using credentials still requires a complete ChatGPT login.

For an unresolved legacy slot, including one without a matching saved snapshot hint, keep the old slot and register the intended owner with `xswap add --login --email owner@example.com --slot UNUSED_SLOT`. Set its alias and directory mappings explicitly with `rename`, `map` and `unmap`; moving or swapping slots keeps mappings attached to their existing accounts. The old credentials and metadata remain until you explicitly use `remove`. Resolve multiple matching legacy registrations explicitly before retrying; `remove` retains credential homes.
